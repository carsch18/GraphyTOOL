2. Create a class that inherits from Scene
3. Implement the construct(self) method with the animation
4. Use proper Manim syntax and methods
5. Make the animation educational and visually appealing
6. Keep it simple but effective
7. Add appropriate colors and timing

```python
from manim import *

class DemoScene(Scene):
